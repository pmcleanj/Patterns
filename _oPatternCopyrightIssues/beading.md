Double-needle applique (left) uses two threads. On the bead thread are lined
up a number -- usually not too many -- of beads which are laid down on
the fabric where they go in the pattern, which is being made by one
continuous thread making sinuous curves that give the patrn its
dynamic. The second needle holds the whipping thread, which whips over
the beading thread between each bead -- or every few beads in for
faster, sloppier beadworkers.

![Rosette beadwork]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/rosette.png)The
easiest pattern for the novice beadworker to learn applique on is the
circular rosette. The dimensions of
the squat cylinder which is a seed bead's shape will determine exactly
how many beads form a smooth circle around the center. By varying the
colors -- this is sometimes done by counting of copying a pattern, but
usually by eye if doing your own -- the circular rosette can make a
variety of patterns, often radial ones, for neck medallions and other
small circular objects.

Enough beads are put on the beading
thread to close each ring (which is done with the beading thread, as
shown). The beads are then whipped down, usually with a whipstitch over
the bead thread between every bead. There's a limit to the size of
circular patterns you can make, that depends to some extent on the
relative diameter and heights of the beads. Sooner or later the rings
can't form smooth circles any more. No amount of care or bead sizing
can defeat this; it is caused by the fact that <i>pi</i> is an
irrational number, while the numbers of beads in any ring (or along
some radii) is not only rational but integer (whole or counting
number)!

![Peyote beadwork]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/bottle.png)
is a technique that young beadworkers find easy to learn. Not that
anyone would find it easy to make a big peyote bead cover like this
one, with its complex pattern, smooth shape over the many diameters of
the wine bottle. This tight, smooth covering won Lorene Thomas, Pyramid
Lake Reservation Paiute, second prize at the 1977 Intertribal Indian
Ceremonial at Gallup, NM, and is now in a California museum (Coe
collection).

![Peyote beadwork]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/peyoteb.png)Peyote
beadwork gets its name because it has been very widely used for a long
time to cover handles of fans, rattles, sticks and other items used in
rituals of the Native American (peyote) Church. At the right, this
single needle single-thread technique is shown. Going back through
alternate beads to form the next row creates a diamond-shaped pattern
of the solid finished beads.

Most often, peyote beadwork is joined
in a circle to form the hollow "woven" cylinders of seed bead earrings,
or long hollow ropes for neck medallions -- sometimes left hollow, but
often beaded around a rope. It's also done to make covers for cigarette
lighters, and to cover bottles to turn them into beautiful vases or
lamp bases, as well as to ornament shakers, fans and dance
paraphernalia. Peyote beading goes fast, and you don't need to carry
around a lot of items other than beads, a supply of thread, and the
very fine hairlike needles used with the smaller-hole beads.

It makes an especially fine showing
when the old-style cut glass beads are used. The best of these are
still made in Czechoslovakia and (once again) are being imported to be
sold via specialty dealers in Native crafts materials. For quite a few
years, you couldn't get them, and some people picked apart older items
made with that type of bead to make new things.

![Lazy-stitch beadwork]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/lazy1.png)
\Lazy stitch is used on Plains beadwork, and by 
most everyone to bead
Plains-style moccasins, buckskin dance dress yokes and similar items.
As the diagram shows, the method is to
pull 4-8 beads on a loop tightly down to the material's surface, either
running a holding stitch part-way into leather, or all the way through
fabric. Some beadworkers also go through the end bead with a
lock-stitch, from which the next loop of beads will start, so that if
one pulls loose, the others won't be affected. The tight, flat loops of
lazy-stitch beads are about as long as dyed, flattened quills, which
are sometimes combined with seed beads -- the very old, traditional,
and the newer beads that came as trade goods.

![Loom beadwork]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loom.png)Loom-Woven beadwork is the last common modern seed bead 
technique. A variety of different
kinds of looms are used, mostly home made. Though loom-woven beadwork
can be fairly wide -- some bandolier straps were made that are 6 inches
wide -- it is mostly used for tassels, belts, hatbands, and necklace
supports for medallions, narrower and done with a needle and small loom
(sometimes a couple of combs) to hold the weft threads. The diagram shows how it works. The bead
string, containing 1 fewer beads than there are weft threads (including
th edges which actually are usually 2 threads each edge) is run under
the weft, and pushed up with the finger. The needle is then pushed back
through the row, so the thread goes above the weft threads. There are 2
threads, one below and one above the weft that go through the holes in
each row. Together they hold the rows tightly in place between the weft
threads, and each weft thread spreads the beads slightly, holding them
in columns the length of the weaving. There is no real limit to this
length, you roll up finished work and continue weaving until ready to
finish off a length. There are many different ways to finish a woven
strip's end. The most usual holds the weft threads with some knots that
leave even ends, for a belt, hatband, or necklace. Danglers of various
kinds are added if the woven strips are to be tassels.
