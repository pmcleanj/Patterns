This is a great stash reducing scarf. It's a simple and straight forward lace pattern that is easy to knit and to remember.
<p></p>
<b>Yarn:</b><br>
This scarf is knit with a ribbon yarn and a kid mohair yarn combined. 
For the kid mohair you could use anywhere from a lace weight up to a 
light worsted or DK weight with no problem.
<p></p>
<b>Needles:</b><br>
6-7 mm (US 10 to 11) 
<p></p>

<b>Gauge:</b><br>
Not too important as it will vary with the yarn combination you choose. 
For a wide enough scarf, and to prevent a dense fabric avoid using 
needles smaller than 6 mm (US 10).
<p></p>
<b>Instructions:</b>
<p></p>
Note:Every row has a border stitch at the beginning and end. To work the
 border stitch, slip first stitch of every row as if to purl; knit the 
last stitch of every row.<br>
CO 23 sts.<br>
<b>Row 1:</b> 1 border stitch; work the 6 stitch pattern repeat 3 times; work last 3 sts of chart; finish with a border stitch.<br>
<b>Rows 2 - 8:</b> Continue chart as above; don't forget the initial and final border sts.
<p></p>
Work rows 1-8 of chart  a total of 11 times. Then, work  rows 1 to 6.
<p></p>
For the neck portion of the scarf follow these steps:
<br>
<b>Row 95:</b> border stitch, *K1, P1* repeat till the last stitch, the border stitch, which should be a knit st.<br>
<b>Rows 96 - 153:</b> Continue in k1, p1 ribbing for a total of 59 rows, end with a RS row.<br>
<b>Row 154 (WS):</b> Begin chart at row 8.<br>

<b>Rows 155 - 244:</b> Work rows 1-8 of chart a total of 11 times ending with chart row 8.<br>

<b>Rows 245 - 250:</b> Knit rows 1 to 6 of chart.
<p></p>
BO loosely (or with a needle one size larger) by knitting the k sts and purling the p sts as they present themselves.

<b>Chart Legend:</b><br>
<b>Blank boxes:</b> Knit<br>
<b>Black Dot:</b> Purl<br>
<b>Empty circle:</b> Yarn over (If the stitch prior to the yarn over is a
 purl stitch and the following stitch is knit, simply knit the next 
stitch without bringing the yarn down to the back of the work, this will
 create a yarnover. If the stitch prior to the yarnover is a knit stitch
 and the following one is a purl stitch, make one complete 
counter-clockwise wrap of yarn around the right-hand needle bringing the
 yarn up to the front of the work just prior to purling the next 
stitch.)<br>
<b>Slash-3:</b> Slip 1 stitch as if to knit, knit 2 together, pass slipped stitch back over the 2nd stitch and off the right-hand needle.
