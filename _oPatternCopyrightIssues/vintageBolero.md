My goal on this pattern is to convert it from being knit flat and sewn together, to knit 
in a single piece. Since it drops from the shoulder, rather than being a raglan line knit
in the round and dropped from the neck, to knit it in a single piece you must cast on the 
shoulder line using a two-sided cast-on such as Judy's Magic Cast-on.
