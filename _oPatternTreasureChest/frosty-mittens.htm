</font></b><strong></strong><p><strong>Frosty Mohair-Sock yarn Child's Mittens</strong> (6-8 yr old) My design.</p>
<em><p>Materials</p>
<p>Small amount sock yarn -- maybe 20 grams or less. Regia, Fortissima,
Wildfoot, fingering weight (baby yarn can be used. Wool is best) </p>
<p>Small amounts of lace weight mohair or mohair blend. (same as above in yardage.) </p>
<p>Short length of satin ribbon 1/8" inch --about 7 inches. Can re-use this.</p>
<p>Set of 4 or 5 double pointed needles in US 3 and US 4. (2.5 to 3.25 mm and 3.75 to 4.0 mm in Metric)</p>
</em><p>Cast on 36 in the round, with one strand varigated sock yarn,
one strand lace weight mohair. Knit 18 rounds in 1x1 knit purl rib.
Knit plain for 1 inch. </p>
<p>Thumb trick: Knit a piece of thin 1/8 inch satin ribbon over 7
stitches at the start of next round (right hand mitten) and then knit
the yarn back over the ribbon and keep going until mitten is about 3
3.5 inches from beginning of plain knit part. </p>
<p>Narrow the top: start at side: k1, ssk, knit to stitch 16, k2tog, k1, then</p>
<p>k1, ssk, knit to 3 st before end (st 34) k2tog, k1. This is decrease row.</p>
<p>Next row: knit plain</p>
<p>Repeat decrease and plain row until 6 stitches remain on front and
back. Weave these using kitchener stitch (graft) or do three needle
bind off. </p>
<p>Pull out the ribbon. 7 stitches on top, 7 on bottom. Pick up these,
with 1 extra twisted stitch from the gap at each side onto 4 needles.
(I use size US 4 for the main mitten and use size US 3 for the thumb.)
Knit 2 inches for thumb.</p>
<p>Narrow thumb: next row, k2, k1; repeat</p>
<p>K 1 row</p>
<p>Then k2, k1 again next row. </p>
<p>Break yarn, run through stitches, pull tight to close thumb.</p>
<p>Weave in all ends and tighten-stitch any gaps with tails of yarn.
Block by pressing lightly with moist towel and iron unless you used
acrylic in which case DON'T.</p>
<p>repeat for second, reverse shaping so thumb is on left palm.</p>
<em></em><p><em>ssk = sl 2 to right needle, knit through back or sk1,k1 psso.</em></p>
<p><em>k2tog, knit two together.</em></p>
<p><em>k knit p purl</em></p>
<p><em>Kitchener graft:put stitches on 2 needles, 6 st front, 6 back.
Hold right sides out. Break yarn, leave about 10 inches. Thread a blunt
needle with this end. Sl 1 front as to knit SLIP OFF NEEDLE, slip one
front as to purl, LEAVE ON NEEDLE; slip 1 back as to PURL then SLIP OFF
NEEDLE, slip 1 back as to knit, LEAVE ON NEEDLE. REPEAT until all
stitches are woven, weave in end of yarn. Trim.</em></p><dir>
