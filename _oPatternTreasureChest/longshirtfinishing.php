</font></b></b><p>
<b><b><font size="3">IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER if you finish the bottom,
front, and back of a longshirt after Step C "Sew Panels Together" and
before attaching the cape and sewing the top together. It is VERY MUCH
EASIER if you finish the cape before attaching it in Step G.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">There are three kinds of finishing touches:
ruffles, straight strip applique, and complex applique. After the
1920's or so, bands of patchwork were used instead of complex applique.
</font></b></b></p><p>

</p><p>
<b><b><font size="3"><font size="4"><i>RUFFLES</i></font> 
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Every longshirt has ruffles. They are always in
some places, such as the cape edge and the body bottom edge. They may
or may not be in other places, like on the cuffs, across the shoulders,
and where the sleeves are joined to the body.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">A narrow ruffle went all the way up both edges of
the front opening prior to 1860. After 1870, the front ruffle stopped
about halfway up, at or slightly higher than the hip ruffle. By the
1980's, this ruffle again goes all the way up the front.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">After 1870, there is always a narrow 2"-3" ruffle
running around the longshirt at about hip level, and occasionally a
second narrower ruffle a few inches above that. The second, higher
ruffle never appears without some kind of complex applique between it
and the hip ruffle. The diagonal ruffle suggested in the instructions
exists on only one known example (Sturtevant, 1956).
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">To make all your ruffles, simply tear the fabric
into strips of desired width. Don't waste your time cutting or hemming
the edges. It's the same way the Seminoles did it!
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">(See also Appendix *2* Pleats) There is more than one way to attach a ruffle:
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">(A) Simply lay the gathered ruffle edge over the
edge of the cape or coat. Sew down. This raw edge may be left visible,
especially on the body of early 19th century longshirts, or the edge
may be covered with straight applique.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">(B) Lay the gathered ruffle back to back against
the cloth edge. Sew together, open up, and fold the hem back against
the front of the cloth. Cover with straight applique.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">(C) Lay the gathered ruffle face to face against
the cloth edge. Sew together, and open up. When sewing straight
applique up against the ruffle, be sure to also sew down the hem on the
back away from the ruffle.
</font></b></b></p><p>
</p><center><b><b><font size="3"><img src="longshirtfinishing_files/long10a"></font></b></b></center>

<p>
<b><b><font size="3"><font size="4"><i>STRAIGHT APPLIQUE </i></font>
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Every longshirt has straight strip applique.
Commercially made single fold bias tape is excellent to use for this,
especially when the applique is narrow enough to be piping. There are
always three of these straight narrow 1/4" to 1/3" strips added inside
the edge of the ruffles on the cape and two or three above the bottom
edge ruffle, and up the front edges and up the back seam above the tail
slit. After 1870, two or three always appear above the narrow hip ruff,
and also above the second waist ruff if there is one.
</font></b></b></p><p>
</p><center><b><b><font size="3"><img src="longshirtfinishing_files/long11a"></font></b></b></center>

<p>
<b><b><font size="3">After 1870, there might also be as many as five
above the bottom ruffle and up the tail slit and rear seam for about a
foot. This bottom straight applique usually seems to run a little
higher up on the rear seam than up the front opening, where it rarely
extend past the top of the front opening ruffle. In the back, it may or
may not be squared off at the top, (but this is usual in post-1980
longshirts). In modern (post 1930) longshirts, the straight applique
can continue up along the rear closed seam to the middle of the back,
or even almost up to the shoulderblades.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Colors used tend to be limited to white, red,
black, and gold, with turquoise and other colors occasionally included
(see Appendix *3* Straight Applique Colors).
</font></b></b></p><p>
</p><center><b><b><font size="3"><font size="2"><i>SOME EXAMPLES OF STRAIGHT APPLIQUE ON CAPES:</i></font>
<br>
<img src="longshirtfinishing_files/long11b"></font></b></b></center>

<p>
<b><b><font size="3"><font size="4"><i>COMPLEX APPLIQUE</i></font>
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Most, but not every, pre-patchwork longshirts have
complex applique. Pre-1850s long shirts that had this seem to have had
not much more than a crossed zig-zag pattern. One set of continuous V's
were sewn down, and then crossed by another set of V's in contrasting
colors. In a couple of examples, threads were pulled loose off the
lower edges of these strips to make a very short fringe.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">McKenney-Hall's portrait of Tukosee Mathla shows
three strips of what has to be simple cut and stitch applique along the
bottom of his coat. The leftmost figure in Sturtevant, 1962, has what
could be a diamond applique strip sketched along the bottom of his
coat.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Post-1870 examples have very nice applique
patterns with a lot of variety and widths from 2" to 4". It is the rare
longshirt that does not have some kind of complex applique between the
bottom ruffle and the hip ruffle, and many have another narrower, less
complex applique band above the hip ruffle.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">The authors know of only two or three longshirts
with commercially made rickrack, and none later than on the cape in a
1940 photo taken by Deaconess Bedell. Do NOT use rickrack for any
applique shortcuts.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Two to four layers of material might be used in a
complex applique design. Applique patterns are created with cloth cut
open and folded back to expose an underlying contrasting fabric, or cut
to shape and sewn down on top of a contrasting color. Almost all
fabrics are solid colors, and the colors are usually the same as those
used for straight applique (see Appendix *3* Straight Applique Colors.)
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">There is an option that's much easier than ripping
strips of material that must be pressed before using. It is craft
ribbon, found in craft shops and the hobby section of many fabric
stores. They come in 1" to 3" widths, and are highly starched, which
makes the fabric easier to fold over for sewing. The starch washes out
later on.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Meanwhile, don't be too annoyed if your cuts and
edges are not precise. Most Seminole examples definitely show a free
attitude toward "floating" edges with the pattern.
