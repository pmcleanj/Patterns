</a>Fig. 85<!--mstheme--></font></font></h6>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">In my young days on the Plains of the North, we put on moccasins over three
pairs of stockings at the end of October, and wore no other footgear till the
early part of March. A possible exception to this was that each of us had a pair
of rubbers that could be slipped over the moccasins when we had to do our daily
task in the sloppy by-product of the stable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Once in a while, there came amongst us an Easterner or a European who was
determined to wear the same boots in the Northwest as he did in his Eastern
home. He was usually in the hospital with frozen feet within a month.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Thus, the Indian moccasins, with their warmth, their foot play, and their
perfect circulation, were an essential of comfort during five months of the year
in all of the region that lies north of latitude forty-nine degrees.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">In that country each of us had to stock up with moccasins or else make our
own when winter drew near. So that the making of moccasins was as well known as
the knitting of socks. All of us could do a little of it; most of us had
mastered the subject.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">This was the condition till the Mennonites came in, and introduced a new type
of moccasin made of thick felt with a rubber sole. They were very comfortable,
but very heavy; and are now commonly worn by all teamsters in the Northwest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">In our moccasin days there were two types well known: (i) the Ojibway or
Pucker-top moccasin, with a soft sole, and soft uppers, made of buckskin
leather; and (2) the Sioux type, --which had a hard or rawhide sole, because the
people who originated it lived in a country abounding with cactus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">For the benefit of those who wish to make their own moccasins for Indian
dancing, I give instructions as follows:</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Ojibway or Pucker-top Moccasin (Fig. 85)<!--mstheme--></font></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">This was usually made of three pieces, each a different kind of leather -the
sole of the heaviest moosehide, the ankle flaps of thin, soft buckskin, and the
inset or tongue of the finest caribou leather, elaborately decorated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><i>The Sole.</i> Set your foot
on a good thick piece of moose leather (A), and trace
the outline of your foot as shown. Outside of this line, draw another,
2 inches
from it, except in the middle where it is but 1 1/2 inches away. At the
heel the line is straight across with a little heel flap, left
on. Cut along this outer line-and your sole is ready.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><i>The Ankle Flap or Uppers.</i> These are of any soft leather; doeskin or antelope
does quite well. The pattern is as shown in B, but the scale must be adapted to
your own foot.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><i>The Tongue or Inset.</i> For the best moccasins this is usually made of fine white caribou leather
embroidered with beads, quills, or silks (C). The embroidery is done, of course,
before the tongue is sewn in. The sole may wear out, but the tongue does not.&nbsp;
It is commonly removed from one pair of
moccasins to another.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">When rough-and-ready Ojibway moccasins are needed both of the pair are alike--there are no lefts or rights. But a
fine pair of moccasins commonly has the tongues decidedly right and left--this
gives a much more elegant and fitted appearance.</font></p>
<h6 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><a href="http://www.inquiry.net/images/rrm085.gif"><img src="ETSmoccasins_files/rrm085_small1" alt="rrm085.gif (7259 bytes)" border="2" height="55" width="100"><br>
</a>Fig. 85.<br>
Ojibway Moccasin<!--mstheme--></font></font></h6>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">The patterns in Fig. 85 were made for a foot 8 inches long. This fact must
be kept in mind while making the patterns for your own foot. Keep the same ratio
in all parts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">When ready to assemble your parts take a strong needle and heavy linen thread
(unless you wish to work with sinew). Begin at A, and run a puckering string all
around the edge (a, b, c, d, e), with a stitch every quarter of an inch: draw
this string tight, adjust it carefully and evenly. Then your moccasin top will
be as at D, with the tongue inset.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Insert the tongue or inset (as in D), stitch it onto the inner rim of the
pucker, and an inch back of this on either side-that is, to (h) and (i).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Now, put the moccasin on your foot; draw JJ to KK at the heel to make sure of
the fit; all adjustment is made at the heel seam. When these are right, close
the seam and finish by sewing the heel flap up against the seam.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Next, stitch the ankle flaps B along the upper edge of the sole piece, sewing
it on solidly from the heel along each side to the beginning of the pucker on
each side of the front.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Run a 24-inch buckskin thong through the 6 holes shown in the base of the
ankle flaps, making sure that at the heel end it is outside--and the moccasins are
ready for use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">These Woodland moccasins are
quite the best for the deep, dry snows of the Saskatchewan; but the
arid, thorny, cactus-strewn plains
of the Missouri call for a harder and more resistant make, represented
by the footgear of the Sioux.&nbsp;</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Sioux or Heard-sole Moccasin&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></font></h3>
<h6 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><a href="http://www.inquiry.net/images/rrm086.gif"><img src="ETSmoccasins_files/rrm086_small" alt="rrm086.gif (8736 bytes)" border="2" height="41" width="100"><br>
</a>Fig. 86<!--mstheme--></font></font></h6>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">The chief peculiarity of this is the thick, hard sole, often made rawhide.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><i>Sole. </i> Set your foot in the selected piece of heavy leather or rawhide,
and draw the outline. Cut it out as at A for the left foot, reversing the
pattern for the right. Bevel the edge of this so as to get the fore shown in E.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><i>Upper. </i> Now, cut the uppers out of soft leather, following the pattern B. This
is an inch longer than A, but of the same width as the length of A at the widest
part or bottom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Any embroidery or ornamentation that is planned should be done o the upper at
this time (D).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Make the two cuts dc and ab. Now, stitch the edges of the upper D to the
edges of the sole A, as at E, beginning at the toe and working back to the heel
on each side, leaving the closing of the heel till the last thing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Sometimes, the moccasins are turned inside-out for this stitching.&nbsp; It makes
a neater job but is not easy with a hard sole.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><i>Tongue.</i> The tongue, C, is of soft leather. It is sewn on to the upper at ab,
but overlaps at each side so as to leave no opening. Sew up the heel, perforate
for strings as shown, and the moccasin is ready.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">This type of moccasin is always in rights and lefts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">An even more effective sole is made thus: Cut your rawhide 1/2 inch wider than
your foot all around. Then make a board exactly the size of your foot, and about
an inch thick, with rounded edges. Soak your sole till soft; then bend and
hammer it on the board and up on the edges. Tack or bind it there till set and
dry. Then take it off, and stitch to the uppers as already set forth. The upper
is, of course, smaller with this larger sole. Oftentimes during work, the leather may be made more
tractable by dampening it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">This Sioux style is more
troublesome to make than the pucker-top; but it
protects the foot better and keeps the stitching from wearing out
against the
ground. On the other hand, I often found that in severe winter weather
the hard-sole moccasin gets unpleasantly smooth and slippery, as well
as less
stimulant of good foot circulation.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Moccasins Made of <a name="Sneakers"> Sneakers</a><!--mstheme--></font></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">I have given instructions for the making of Indian moccasins, in strictly
Indian fashion (Figs. 85 and 86) . But we have found, in most of the Woodcraft
camps, that it is easier, cheaper, and in the long run more satisfactory, to
make your moccasins out of a pair of gym sneaks. These are sure to be
comfortable, and adequately protect the feet. The cost of them complete is less than the buckskin alone would cost to make
Indian moccasins.</font></p>
<h6 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><a href="http://www.inquiry.net/images/rrm087.gif"><img src="ETSmoccasins_files/rrm087_small" alt="rrm087.gif (50379 bytes)" border="2" height="148" width="100"><br>
</a>Fig. 87.<!--mstheme--></font></font></h6>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">In Fig. 87, I give a series of
decorations that can be applied to the sneaks, either as paint, beads,
silk embroidery, or applique'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Paint--that is, solid oil paint--is most easily and effectively used.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">A black outline in waterproof ink, or indelible pencil, is often very helpful
to emphasize the pattern. It is assumed that the sneaks are either white or
brown to begin with.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">If you follow the directions on the Plate--that is, the colors indicated by
the lines or dots--then actually color the Plate with water colors, you will get a much better idea of the effect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">No. 1 (A and B) is a design in red and white, painted on the tan color of the
sneak.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">No. 2 is red on a green ground, with white triangles at the side; and is most
easily done on a white sneak. .</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">No. 3 is on a white sneak, a design in red with blue center. The fringe is of
leather, sewn on the outer edge of the opening; and may be much longer if desired.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">No. 4 is a very simple pattern of red and white on the tan color of the sneak.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">No. 5 is white chiefly-that is,
it is a white sneak with a blue and white band near the sole, a red
circle in front around which is a ring of
pale green and rays of deep yellow or orange. I have seen this one done
in
embroidery of silk as well as painted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">No. 6 is a white sneak with a green top, center and feather of deep yellow or
orange, tipped with blue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">No. 7 also is a white sneak, with orange top, blue triangles, and a band of
red all around next the sole.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">All may be fringed if desired.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Almost any good Indian moccasin pattern may be reproduced in colors on a
sneak; but the beginner especially is advised not to try original designs-at
least, not until after a long course of exactly copying those made by Indians.</font></p>
