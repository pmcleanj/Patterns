<p><b><font face="Georgia"><font size="+1">INTRODUCTION</font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are
the guidelines for clothing to be used at battles, parades, and other events
which are open to the public.&nbsp; You are not required to have medieval
clothing simply to be a member, and there are non-public events such as
feasts and workshops at which period clothing is encouraged but not necessarily
controlled.</font>
<br><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For public
events, however, there is growing concern being given to maintaining a
reasonably historical appearance.&nbsp; In most cases, the <i>Basic Clothing
Standards</i> will be more than acceptable to all concerned, and using
them as your guide is probably the easiest and least expensive way to keep
your level of authenticity high.</font>
<br><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These Standards
cover common medieval clothing in a very general way, but the effect they
give is a very typical medieval appearance.&nbsp; It is also a very flexible
appearance, suitable to a number of different cultures across a time span
of over 500 years.&nbsp; It is often possible to change from one nationality
or time frame to another just by changing hats!</font>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The descriptions
and patterns for all garments and accessories are as accurate as possible
while still applying to the widest possible span of time and place.&nbsp;
Less common variations and exceptions to the rule have been omitted, as
have some features which are still debatable or poorly documented.&nbsp;
These guidelines, therefore, are not unwavering fact, but they are a good
place to start for anyone dressing for the Middle Ages.</font>

</p><p><b><font face="Georgia">MEN</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Georgia"><a href="http://www.larp.com/midgard/tunic.htm">TUNIC</a> -- Knee-length or
longer, except for some shorter Norse styles; flared with triangular gores
at the sides and/or front and back.&nbsp; Sleeves are long and fit closely
along the forearms.&nbsp; Generally, a wool tunic is worn over a linen
undertunic.&nbsp; The belt can be leather or fabric, either with a plain
D-shaped buckle, or with a long fork in one end that ties through two slits
in the other (see <a href="http://www.larp.com/midgard/access.htm">Accessories</a>).</font>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">LEGWEAR -- Usually close-fitting--can be <a href="http://www.larp.com/midgard/hosen.htm">hosen</a>,
just thigh-length fabric tubes, or <a href="http://www.larp.com/midgard/braies.htm">trousers</a>; either
can have full feet, or have stirrups, or be footless. Some Vikings and
Slavs wore straight-legged trousers that ended at the ankle, much like
modern trousers.&nbsp; Any type of trousers&nbsp; may have a drawstring
waist or belt loops.&nbsp; Hosen are worn over <a href="http://www.larp.com/midgard/braies.htm">Braies</a>,
short linen pants gathered and tied below the knee.&nbsp; A pair of strings
sewn ot the waist of the braies tie to loops or holes at the top of the
hosen to support them.&nbsp; Knee- or cross-garters may be worn, or (particularly
for Saxons) legwraps called winingas or "windings" (wool bands like WWI
puttees).</font>
</p><p><font face="Georgia"><a href="http://www.larp.com/midgard/shoes.htm">SHOES</a> -- Commonly leather
and ankle-height (or a couple inches&nbsp; above), with a flat sole. Can
be "slip-ons", buttoned or laced at the side, or drawstringed. Most had
pointed toes, but Norse fashions included round toes.</font>
</p><p><b><font face="Georgia">WOMEN</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Georgia"><a href="http://www.larp.com/midgard/gown.htm">GOWN or DRESS</a> -- Generally
a linen underdress, ankle-length or longer, with long, snug sleeves, and
gores to give flare and fullness.&nbsp; Remember that decent ladies exposed
only the face and hands--no slit hems, plunging necklines, or gaping bodices,
please!&nbsp;&nbsp; Women's hosen need only be knee-length.</font>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">Saxons: Unfitted overgown may be shorter, with
untapered three-quarter-length sleeves.</font>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">Normans and French: Full-length overgown either
unfitted or snug in the torso, sleeves either long and snug or flared (later
11th to 12th centuries).</font>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">Norse: Apron dresses (see <a href="http://www.larp.com/midgard/viking.html">Viking
Clothing</a>) worn over gowns which might have been pleated.</font>
</p><p><font face="Georgia"><a href="http://www.larp.com/midgard/headwear.htm">HEADCOVERINGS</a> -- Women
should cover their heads!! Most common is the veil--a white linen oval
about 22"x36" draped over the head and held with a narrow band.</font>
</p><p><b><font face="Georgia"><font size="+1">FIRST TIME?</font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are
just getting started and don't have time to finish your clothing before
the event, here are shortcuts which may help.&nbsp; At most events, the
organizers will have no problem with these expediencies, though they may
recommend that you borrow something that you lack.&nbsp; Eventually you'll
want to replace these stop-gap items, not only for the satisfaction and
fun of looking good, but also because "the real thing" works better!</font>
<br><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately,
a tunic or gown can't really be "faked", so borrowing is your best option
if you can't make or buy one in time.&nbsp; Try to contact the organizer
or another participant ahead of time to be sure that spare clothing will
be available.&nbsp; Trousers that are too loose can often be greatly improved
simply by tying them with cross-garters, or wrapping them with long bands
of leather or wool called "winingas" or windings.&nbsp; For shoes, there
are several types of moccassins which will work, including inexpensive
"Inca boots".&nbsp; Knee-high "Apache" boots are generally not acceptable,
but they can be cut down to about ankle very easily, and the leftover leather
laces used for cross-garters!</font>
<br><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There!&nbsp;
A borrowed tunic, some leather thongs for cross-garters, and a pair of
cheap moccassins, and you're off to your first event.&nbsp; What could
be simpler?&nbsp; Have fun!</font>
</p><p><b><font face="Georgia"><font size="+1">RECOMMENDATIONS</font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LINEN and
WOOL were by far the most common medieval fabrics, so that's what to look
for when getting ready to make your own clothing.&nbsp; They are far more
comfortable than cotton or modern synthetics, and much safer around candles
and campfires as well.&nbsp; Use solid colors--checks or patterns may have
existed but were very rare in most areas.&nbsp; Don't bother to pick a
color scheme, and be aware that black is rather over-used these days.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, most modern trims should be avoided, but cuffs, hems, and
necklines can be decorated with bands of contrasting color of fabric.&nbsp;
Embroidery should be well-researched, and appropriated to time and place
(e.g., don't put Celtic designs on a Viking tunic).</font>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-wash your
fabric!&nbsp; Ignore the "dry clean only" label--modern wools need a good
thrashing in the machine (permanent press or gentle cycle) to give them
the proper felted texture, then hang to dry.&nbsp; Linen needs its cut
ends secured against ravelling with a zig-zag stitch or a quick hem, then
wash is on a normal cycle and hang or machine dry.&nbsp; Pre-washing shrinks
the fabric at least 3 or 4 inches per yard (length and width!), so always
buy extra.&nbsp; Iron well with steam just before cutting.</font>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you really
want to impress your friends and the public, take the time to hand sew
visible stitching such as cuffs or hems with the old needle and thread,
using a plain running stitch, backstitch, or whip stitch.&nbsp; It's easy,
educational, and can be fun!&nbsp; Don't leave raw or ragged edges because
of the misconception that "medieval = crude".&nbsp; Anyone too poor to
buy a new tunic would certainly take care of the old one!</font>
</p><p><b><font face="Georgia"><font size="+1">KEEP IT SIMPLE!</font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid the urge to embellish
your appearance with inauthentic things like vests, wide kidney belts,
long flowing capes, daggers, armguards, square tied-on leggings, and boots
(especially "apache" boots!).&nbsp; Many people unwittingly spoil their
look by adding inappropriate items to what could otherwise be good clothing.&nbsp;
Cluttering pieces of mail and leather are simply fantasy, while fur--which
was used in several ways in the Middle Ages--is frequently mis-used nowadays.&nbsp;
So keep it simple!&nbsp; A tunic, hosen, and shoes may seen unexciting,
but it is very easy and very medieval.</font>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish
to wear something not included in the Standards, you may need to find evidence
of its existence.&nbsp; (If someone in charge of an event disagrees with
you, he does not have to prove you wrong--it is up to you to prove yourself
right.)&nbsp; Use medieval illustrations and descriptions (these are "primary
sources") whenever possible; some recent (last 15-20 years) secondary sources
are pretty good, too, but most things written in the 19th and early 20th
centuries are worthless for clothing research.</font>
</p><p><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you are
getting your garb together, whether sewing or buying, TAKE YOUR TIME, and
put some effort to get everything right the first time.&nbsp; Ask around
for help with researching or sewing--there are plenty of experienced reenactors
who will be happy to lend a hand or a book.&nbsp; If someone does tell
you that something of yours is wrong or inappropriate, don't assume he's
an ignorant jerk (even if he acts like one!).&nbsp; Find a convenient time
to talk to that person about your disagreement--this is supposed to be
educational as well as fun, after all.</font>
