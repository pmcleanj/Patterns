<p>
<b><b><font size="3"><font size="4"><i>FABRICS </i></font>
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Some McKenney-Hall portraits seem to indicate wool
or strouding could have been used, from the ways the fabric hangs and
folds. The Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, has a
buckskin example, and also one made of "chintz. n But, a re-enactor
should prefer the commonly used cotton, especially if he can locate
100% cotton. (The Joanne Fabrics chain of stores carries a wide variety
of 100% cotton cloth in old-style prints at a very good price.) They
are made from a variety of geometric or floral prints, paisleys
ginghams, calicos, and stripes. If you decide to use plaids or
ginghams, try to located woven and not printed designs. Calicos,
stripes, and fine prints were used more before the 1890's, and solids
used more regularly after that. A pre-1860 re-enactor has an even wider
freedom of choice in large paisleys wide stripes and bright calicos.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Most longshirts in museums seem to be red, black,
or dark blue, but other colors are noted. Many good fixed dye colors
weren't perfected until the late 19th century by the Germans. We don't
yet know of a resource that outlines a history of color dyes to know
what colors were readily available in the early 19th century.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">If the Seminoles can be said to have any color
preferences, those would probably be reds and blues. But, don't
consider yourself limited to those. Keep in mind that all known written
references to old-style Seminole leggings describe them as red
(although we know there were dark blue ones as well.) The apex of the
completed outfit, a beaded bandolier and pouch, is always made with red
or blue or black wool strouding, but red wool seems to have been
preferred to the others by two to one (Most, 1990). The re-enactor
should consider choosing another color than red for his longshirt
unless he really wants to be all in that color.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">The prints tend to have medium to dark color
backgrounds, but light colors are not unusual. The cape can be a
different print from the body but is usually at least the same base
color.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">The ruffles that contrast instead of match with
the cape and body fabric are usually a solid color, a very fine print,
or a very narrow pin stripe. If a stripe is used, the lines need to be
at right angles to the edge of the ruffle, not running lengthwise
parallel to the edge. Incidentally, ruffles were almost never hemmed.
They were left cut, and in a few early examples, threads were pulled
loose to get a short fringe effect.

which was always the case. The instructions show a rectangular piece.

Cut the cuffs 3 longer than the loose wrist circumference. The piece
should be 2" to 9" wide. Fold lengthwise, right sides facing and sew
each end with a 1/4" hem. Turn right side out and flatten, either on
the knee or with an iron. Stitch all the way around 1/8" from the edge.
Sew the two ends together with an overcast stitch.

</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Insert the end of the sleeve through the cuff so
that the raw edges of the sleeves and the cuffs meet. Gather the sleeve
with small pleats and pin into place. (See Appendix *2* PLEATS) Sew
down with a tight stitch, either overcast or running. Turn the cuffs
right side out. </font></b></b></p><p>

</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Using the measurement taken from the gusset end of
the sleeve (less 2"), angle a line the same length to the edge of the
fold using a straight edge.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Mark and cut through both layers of fabric. When opened, you should have a large V-shaped opening in each panel, as below:


</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3"><font size="4"><i>TAIL SLIT</i></font>
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">The instructions show a cut for a vent in the
back, called a "tail slit." The tail slit is always there after the
1830's. How wide it is, and how deep it is cut in depends on period and
on personal choice. There are even tail slits left open for which no
specific cuts were made. The cut for a tail slit could therefore be
from 0" to 1" on each side, and its height Can vary from 4" to 8" into
the body of the longshirt. On a contemporary example, seen offered for
sale at the Dania Reservation in 1989, the tail slit was open all the
way up the back as high as the shoulder blades!
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Begin sewing body panels (A) together from the
tail slit (a) to the top (b). Using a simple rolled hem, hem the edges
that make up the front opening. Before proceeding finish the bottom and
sides with whatever applique and ruffles you have chosen (see
"FINISHING").

<p>
<b><b><font size="3"><img src="longshirt_files/long7b" align="right">
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3"><font size="5">D.</font> The collar is, in
reality, nothing more than a neck spacer. It's a double piece of fabric
about 1" or 2" wide and about 3" long when finished. Simply double over
the fabric wrong side out, and sew up each end using an overcast
stitch. Turn right side out, smooth out the sewn ends, and press flat.
Set it aside for now
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3"><font size="5">E.</font> (See Appendix *1* CAPES)
Briefly, the cape is either an equilateral or an isosceles triangle,
depending on period or preference. It was usually modified at the base
of the triangle to resemble a faceted gemstone seen on edge, as below.
It is more or less shoulder wide, depending on period and preference,
and edged with ruffles and straight applique. The cape should be
completely finished before proceeding {See "FINISHING").

<center><table><tbody><tr><td><b>
<font size="5">F.</font> Center the neck spacer over the center seam of
the completed body at the top edge, open side edge to edge with the
body top, midway between sleeve openings. Be certain that it's attached
and on the wrong side of the fabric and hangs down.

<center><table><tbody><tr><td><b>
<font size="5">G.</font> Next, place the finished cape directly over
the spacer as shown below. Be certain that the finished side of the
cape faces against the wrong side of the body. Sew from point A to B
with a tight overcast stitch (about 1/8" apart).

<p>
<b><b><font size="3"><img src="longshirt_files/long8c" align="right">
<font size="5">H.</font> Once the cape and neck spacer are attached,
lift the cape out of the way as shown below. Match each side of the
front to the edge of the neck spacer, and pin at that point to hold in
place. It will be necessary to gather each side to equal the length
between the neck spacer and the shoulder edge (A to B, and A' to B').
(If you have decided on shoulder ruffles, insert them at this time.)
Pin into place as needed, and sew together. If there are no shoulder
ruffles, use a tight overcast stitch the same way you sewed the cape
and neck spacer to the I body. If there are ruffles, you will need to
use a tight running stitch. As you sew, you will be making several
small pleated folds in the front body piece to gather it slightly. (See
Appendix *2* PLEATS)
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3"><img src="longshirt_files/long9a" align="right">
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Turn the body of the shirt inside out. Make certain the sleeves are kept right side out.

</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Match the apex of the gusset with the bottom of
the sleeve opening. If you want a shoulder ruff, insert it at this
time. Pin the sleeve to the body working up each side until you
encounter the gathering.
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3">Adjust the pleats until the gathered portion of
the sleeve and the opening are roughly equal. Insert pin at the
front-back seam of the body panels (P). The center mark you're earlier
should be on that seam. Once you're satisfied all is okay, pin it into
place, continuing until the sleeve is pinned all around. Sew the sleeve
onto the body using an overcast stitch at least º" from the edge, with
stitches about 1/8" apart. Pull them tight, but not enough to cause the
seen youíre stitching to buckle. Repeat the process on the next sleeve,
then try it on for fit. </font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3"><img src="longshirt_files/long9b" align="left">
</font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font size="3"><font size="5">I.</font> The reinforcer can be the
same material or even a darker contrasting piece. Sew it on top of the
shoulder seam from the point where the cape attaches out to the sleeve.
It is stitched on both edges, which are usually turned under, but can
also be left raw. There are a couple of examples in which a contrasting
piece is so wide that the raw edges make narrow ruffles.
