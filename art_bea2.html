<p><font color="#aa0000"><font size="+3">D</font>ouble-needle applique</font> is the beading technique that <a href="http://bioc02.uthscsa.edu/%7Egiese/maude.html">Maude Kegg,</a>
Mille Lacs Ojibwe elder, uses for most of her beadwork, at least in
part. Her 1982 museum bandolier appliques all beads of the pattern, and
the solid white field, on the straps and pouch, which has woven
beadwork tassels.
</p><p><img src="art_bea2_files/applique" align="left" height="116" width="250"><font size="+3">D</font>ouble
needle means there are 2 threads in use. On the bead thread are lined
up a number -- usually not too many -- of beads which are laid down on
the fabric where they go in the pattern, which is being made by one
continuous thread making sinuous curves that give the patrn its
dynamic. The second needle holds the whipping thread, which whips over
the beading thread between each bead -- or every few beads in for
faster, sloppier beadworkers (like me).
</p><p><img src="art_bea2_files/rosette" align="right"><font size="+3">T</font>he
easiest pattern for the novice beadworker to learn applique on is the
circular rosette. That -- the turtle you see above right -- was the
second thing I made (a small pouch to hold tobacco). I gave it away, so
while I don't know if my neice still has it, it always exists very
vividly in my mind. (The first beadwork I made was my AIM Jacket patch,
which is still sewn on my old Sears leather jacket.) The dimensions of
the squat cylinder which is a seed bead's shape will determine exactly
how many beads form a smooth circle around the center. By varying the
colors -- this is sometimes done by counting of copying a pattern, but
usually by eye if doing your own -- the circular rosette can make a
variety of patterns, often radial ones, for neck medallions and other
small circular objects.
</p><p><font size="+3">E</font>nough beads are put on the beading
thread to close each ring (which is done with the beading thread, as
shown). The beads are then whipped down, usually with a whipstitch over
the bead thread between every bead. There's a limit to the size of
circular patterns you can make, that depends to some extent on the
relative diameter and heights of the beads. Sooner or later the rings
can't form smooth circles any more. No amount of care or bead sizing
can defeat this; it is caused by the fact that <i>pi</i> is an
irrational number, while the numbers of beads in any ring (or along
some radii) is not only rational but integer (whole or counting
number)!
</p><p><img src="art_bea2_files/bottle" align="left" height="299" width="89"><font color="#aa0000"><font size="+3">P</font>eyote beadwork</font>
is a technique that young beadworkers find easy to learn. Not that
anyone would find it easy to make a big peyote bead cover like this
one, with its complex pattern, smooth shape over the many diameters of
the wine bottle. This tight, smooth covering won Lorene Thomas, Pyramid
Lake Reservation Paiute, second prize at the 1977 Intertribal Indian
Ceremonial at Gallup, NM, and is now in a California museum (Coe
collection).
</p><p><img src="art_bea2_files/peyoteb" align="right" height="205" width="171"><font size="+3">P</font>eyote
beadwork gets its name because it has been very widely used for a long
time to cover handles of fans, rattles, sticks and other items used in
rituals of the Native American (peyote) Church. At the right, this
single needle single-thread technique is shown. Going back through
alternate beads to form the next row creates a diamond-shaped pattern
of the solid finished beads. </p><p><font size="+3">M</font>ost often, peyote beadwork is joined
in a circle to form the hollow "woven" cylinders of seed bead earrings,
or long hollow ropes for neck medallions -- sometimes left hollow, but
often beaded around a rope. It's also done to make covers for cigarette
lighters, and to cover bottles to turn them into beautiful vases or
lamp bases, as well as to ornament shakers, fans and dance
paraphernalia. Peyote beading goes fast, and you don't need to carry
around a lot of items other than beads, a supply of thread, and the
very fine hairlike needles used with the smaller-hole beads. </p><p><font size="+3">I</font>t makes an especially fine showing
when the old-style cut glass beads are used. The best of these are
still made in Czechoslovakia and (once again) are being imported to be
sold via specialty dealers in Native crafts materials. For quite a few
years, you couldn't get them, and some people picked apart older items
made with that type of bead to make new things.
</p><p><img src="art_bea2_files/lazy1" align="left" height="246" width="166"><font color="#aa0000"><font size="+3">L</font>azy squaw stitch</font>
has come to be regarded as a no-no description, because of the
denigratory white man's distortion of the Ojibwe word for woman, <i>ikwè</i>,
into the pejorative universal "squaw". Nowadays, it's just called Lazy
stitch. It is used on Plains beadwork, and by most everyone to bead
Plains-style moccasins, buckskin dance dress yokes and similar items. </p><p><font size="+3">A</font>s the diagram shows, the method is to
pull 4-8 beads on a loop tightly down to the material's surface, either
running a holding stitch part-way into leather, or all the way through
fabric. Some beadworkers also go through the end bead with a
lock-stitch, from which the next loop of beads will start, so that if
one pulls loose, the others won't be affected. The tight, flat loops of
lazy-stitch beads are about as long as dyed, flattened quills, which
are sometimes combined with seed beads -- the very old, traditional,
and the newer beads that came as trade goods.
</p><p><img src="art_bea2_files/loom" align="right" height="107" width="212"><font color="#aa0000"><font size="+3">L</font>oom-Woven beadwork</font>
is the last common modern seed bead technique. A variety of different
kinds of looms are used, mostly home made. Though loom-woven beadwork
can be fairly wide -- some bandolier straps were made that are 6 inches
wide -- it is mostly used for tassels, belts, hatbands, and necklace
supports for medallions, narrower and done with a needle and small loom
(sometimes a couple of combs) to hold the weft threads.
</p><p><font size="+3">T</font>he diagram shows how it works. The bead
string, containing 1 fewer beads than there are weft threads (including
th edges which actually are usually 2 threads each edge) is run under
the weft, and pushed up with the finger. The needle is then pushed back
through the row, so the thread goes above the weft threads. There are 2
threads, one below and one above the weft that go through the holes in
each row. Together they hold the rows tightly in place between the weft
threads, and each weft thread spreads the beads slightly, holding them
in columns the length of the weaving. There is no real limit to this
length, you roll up finished work and continue weaving until ready to
finish off a length. There are many different ways to finish a woven
strip's end. The most usual holds the weft threads with some knots that
leave even ends, for a belt, hatband, or necklace. Danglers of various
kinds are added if the woven strips are to be tassels, as on Maude
Kegg's bandolier bag.

<li><p><font size="+3">S</font>ources of beads and other beading
supplies from looms to the special needles and threads can be found
from a great many catalog dealers all over the world, but not all of
them carry the kinds used in Indian crafts in the U.S. and Canada. You
can find a <a href="http://www.nativeweb.org/resources/crafts_indigenous_technology/craft_supplies_sources/">short list of U.S. and Canadian craft supply shops</a>
(many of which have catalogs) on Tara Prindle's NativeTech pages.
Scroll on down to find sources of hides. Getting a number of catalogs
will help you make up budgets for school or program craft projects.
NOTE: Do not use purchased hides to make Pipe bags or Medicine pouches.</p>

</li><li><p> A <a href="http://elaine.teleport.com/%7Epaulec/beadshops.html">world-wide list of beadshops</a>
(most of which are hippie or non-Indian or African) is on a special FAQ
maintained and updated by many people for rec.arts.beads newsgroup. </p>

by Judy Kavanaugh. Pictures of some, links to related sites, book
reviws, but her main thing is she makes and sells them (I really wish I
could afford a pair of furry, beaded mukluks!) and also sells kits of
instructions, hides, and sewing materials. Judy also has a "frames"
Inuit fashion show page from a show February 2, with handsome beaded
kamicks -- Netscape 2+ browsers only.</p>

</li><li><p><a href="http://www.sfol.com/sfol/art/morning/morningstar.html">$38,000 beaded buckskin shirt</a>
Created by unrecorded woman from Ft. Berthold (ND) Mandan tribe in
1890. It's the lead-in for Morning Star Gallery of Santa Fe, where you
can get really expensive sort-of antique Native stuff, I mean probably
not <i>you</i> and certainly not <i>me</i>. Backhanded inspiration to
beadworkers -- a century after you're dead, someone will make real
bucks off of it. A similar shirt made in 1982 by Joyce Growing Thunder
Fogarty (Assiniboine -- Ft. Peck Rez) is nicer, it's in a California
museum now, but she didn't get any $38,000 for it. Gallery is stuffed
with pricey properties -- simple tomahawk $12K. Lotta beads over the
dam to even walk in their door. I'd be scared to. No praying or vows or
visions around places like this. Money is their religion.</p>

the logo for all these ArtPages, which are dedicated to his memory. The
strap from Maude Kegg's bandolier bag, and the peyote beadwork bottle
by Lorena Thomas were photographed by Bobby Hansson for the American
Federation of Arts travelling show, "Lost and Found Traditions: Native
American Art, 1965 - 1985.". AFA has lost the color originals. The
catalog I scanned these pictures from has been out of print since 1990,
but the University of Seattle Press still has the pageplates for it. I
made the black and white drawings as part of an intended
native-centered mathematics unit in 1987; this unit was never finished,
though I still have many of the materials prepared for it.</i></p>
