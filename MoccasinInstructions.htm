  and equipment</b></font></h2>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leather</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moose, elk and deer hides 
  are recommended. They are softer and stretchier than other leather like cowhide 
  and pig suede. Deer is thinner than moose and elk but it is easier to do the 
  gathering stitch. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commercially tanned leather 
  has a rough and smooth side and you can put either on the outside of the moccasin. 
  Split moosehide is rough on both sides. Brain-tanned smoked hides are also rough 
  on both sides since the smooth layer of skin is scraped off during tanning. 
  Brain-tanned leather is wonderful to sew but it's very expensive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can buy leather at leather 
  crafts stores, from tanneries or at Native powwows.&nbsp; Leather is usually priced 
  by the square foot. The area of the piece of leather is marked on the hide near 
  the edge in fractions of square feet. There are 2 numbers. The first is whole 
  feet and the second is quarters of square feet. So 10/3 (also written 103) means 
  10 3/4 square feet. Expect to pay $3-$6 per square foot for deer and moosehide, 
  $2-$4 per square foot for split moosehide and $10-$25 or more for brain-tanned 
  smoked deer or moosehide.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stroud</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stroud, or Melton cloth, 
  is a closely woven wool often used for making winter coats. It can be used for 
  the vamps of the moccasins and is especially good for doing beadwork or embroidery 
  on. You can buy it at most fabric stores.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fur</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will need two strips 
  of fur, each 1-2&#8221; wide and about 16-18&#8221; long. Try buying an old fur coat or 
  collar at a second-hand store.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fox fur is long and fluffy 
  and comes in white, grey, black and other colours. Mink is the most durable 
  kind of fur. It is short and is usually dark brown or black. Muskrat is similar 
  to mink but not as expensive. Coyote is long and tan with black and brown markings. 
  Rabbit fur is cheap but tends to shed and wear easily. Beaver is luxurious and 
  fluffy and is a traditional fur for moccasin trim.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When cutting fur, don&#8217;t 
  use scissors or you will cut the fur as well as the skin. Use a knife and hold 
  the fur up off the table to make sure you cut only through the skin.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Artificial sinew</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is used instead of 
  regular thread for sewing leather. It is a strong waxed thread that can be split 
  into strands like embroidery thread. Use 1 or 2 strands to sew your moccasins 
  together. If you cannot find artificial sinew, use a strong thread such as buttonhole 
  or quilting thread.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leather needle</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also called a glover&#8217;s needle. 
  The pointy end of the needle has a three cornered knife edge so that it cuts 
  the leather rather than piercing it. It really makes sewing leather much easier 
  than using a regular needle. Use as small a needle as you can for the thread 
  you are using so it does not leave big holes in the leather. Be careful. Leather 
  needles are sharp!</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lining</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lining should be made 
  out of a soft material such as polar fleece or sweatshirt fleece. It is sewn 
  together with regular thread.</font></p>
<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="Pattern"></a>About 
  the pattern</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are 2 pieces for the 
  moccasin itself: the bottom and the vamp:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="MoccasinInstructions_files/image006" height="198" hspace="12" width="200"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the lining there are 
  3 pieces: the sole, the top and the heel piece:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;<img src="MoccasinInstructions_files/image007" height="170" hspace="12" width="292"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will also need to cut 
  a long thin piece of leather about 1/4" wide and as long as the outside 
  of the vamp. This piece, called a welt,&nbsp; goes in the seam between the vamp and 
  the bottom to strengthen it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="MoccasinInstructions_files/image008" height="242" hspace="12" width="250"></font></p>
<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="CuttingOut"></a>Cutting 
  out the leather and lining</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cutting out the leather </font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leather is a natural material 
  and varies in thickness, colour and stretchiness from piece to piece and within 
  a single hide. Check for holes or markings on the hide before marking your pattern.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Try to make the stretchiest 
  direction of the leather go across your foot instead of from heel to toe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since you can&#8217;t easily pin 
  the pattern to the hide, place the pattern on the wrong side and draw around 
  it CAREFULLY with a pen or soft pencil. Cut only one thickness of leather at 
  a time.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cutting out the lining</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cut this out like a normal 
  sewing pattern by pinning it onto 2 layers of fabric. A 1/4" seam allowance 
  is included in the pattern.</font></p>
<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="Sewing"></a>Sewing 
  techniques</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sewing the leather is done 
  by hand using an overcast or whip stitch. Make a knot at the start and end of 
  the seam.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="MoccasinInstructions_files/image009" height="128" hspace="12" width="260">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stitch two pieces together 
  inside out, with the right sides of the leather facing each other. After the 
  seam is finished, turn the pieces right side out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Try and make your stitches 
  small and neat but realise it does take practise until you can make perfectly 
  uniform stitches. Aim for stitches that are about 1/8&#8221; apart and 1/8&#8221; deep (1/8&#8221; 
  in from the edge of the leather). Pull the thread tight after each stitch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To increase the strength 
  of the seam and give it a neat appearance, you can sew a welt into the seam. 
  This is a strip of leather, ¼&#8221; wide, that is inserted into the seam between 
  the two pieces of leather being joined. After the seam is sewn, trim the welt 
  close to the seam on the right side.</font></p>

  the moccasins</b></font></h2>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="Vamp"></a>Sewing the vamp 
  to the moccasin bottom</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you want to decorate 
  the vamp of your moccasins, do it before you assemble them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sewing the vamp to the bottoms 
  is the hardest part of making moccasins because you have to gather the bottom 
  to fit the vamp. This gives room for your toes. It&#8217;s hard at first to make the 
  tucks or gathers even.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Match up the centre fronts 
  of the vamp and bottom, right sides together. Insert the welt between the vamp 
  and the bottom, matching up the edges. Tack the 3 layers together at the centre 
  front. Tack point A on the vamp to point A on the bottom. Don&#8217;t forget to put 
  the welt between the vamp and the bottom. Do the same on the other side of the 
  foot at the point B. Now you are ready to sew.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="MoccasinInstructions_files/image011" height="499" width="347"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Start at the centre front 
  and sew the seam back to point A, then sew from the centre front back to point 
  B.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At each stitch, make about 
  a 1/8" tuck in the bottom piece. Try to push the tuck close together as 
  you stitch. When you are part way down the seam you will find that you no longer 
  have to make tucks to fit the vamp to the bottom. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you have done both 
  sides, turn the moccasin right side out and trim the welt with a pair of sharp 
  scissors as close to the seam as you can without cutting the stitching.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can sew this seam without 
  the welt if you like but the welt strengthen the seam and helps to hide the 
  stitching. </font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="Lining"></a>Sewing the 
  lining</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lining is sewed inside 
  out and is NOT turned right side out afterwards. With right sides together, 
  sew the heel piece to the top on both sides using a 1/4" seam. Use a sewing 
  machine if you have one. Sew the top to the foot piece forming a slipper shape.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="MoccasinInstructions_files/image012" height="252" hspace="12" width="300"></font></p>
<h3 align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="Heel"></a>Making 
  the heel</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Put the lining on your foot 
  and then slip your foot into the moccasin. The back of the leather should just 
  meet at your heel. If there is extra length, mark it and then trim it off. Take 
  off the moccasin.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Find the middle of the back 
  edge and mark it. Then measure ¾&#8221; on either side of the centre and mark these 
  points. Finally, measure ¾&#8221; in (towards the toe) at the two points and mark 
  them. Cut from the edge to the 2 points like this:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="MoccasinInstructions_files/image014" height="201" hspace="25" vspace="38" width="384"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sew the back seam from the 
  top down to the two cuts. Add a welt in the seam if you wish. Sew the top of 
  the T seam, then cut off the extra flap and sew the bottom of the T using a 
  welt if you like.<br clear="all">
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When complete, the back 
  seam will form an upside down T like this:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="MoccasinInstructions_files/image016" height="148" width="231"></font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="LiningAndFur"></a>Adding 
  the lining</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Insert the lining into the 
  moccasin. Trim the lining to fit exactly around the top edge and baste it to 
  the moccasin. </font></p>
<h3 align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cutting the fur trim</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Measure around the top opening 
  of the moccasin to determine how long a piece of fur you need. Cut a piece of 
  fur this length and 1&#8221;-1 ¼&#8221; wide. Try to make sure the fur for the two feet 
  are similar in colour and thickness.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sewing on the fur trim</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fur is sewn on like 
  you would sew a bias binding. With the right side of the fur facing the right 
  side of the moccasin, sew from the heel seam all around the foot back to the 
  heel using an overcast stitch. Trim any extra length and sew the two ends of 
  the fur together. Turn the moccasin inside out and tack the fur to the inside 
  of the moccasin<b>.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Now put on your moccasins 
  and see how wonderful they feel!</b></font></p>
