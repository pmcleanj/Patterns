This pattern is based on an artifact in the possession of From the Museum and Research 
Center of the American Mountain Men, dating to circa 1900. The general cut of the moccasin is Plains Indian, but 
because the sole has been replaced the actual tribal origin had to be inferred from other 
characteristics.

The cut of the tongue is like a number of Sioux moccasins, but not all Sioux have this cut and 
it is not Sioux exclusively. Also, they do not have the "buffalo hoof-print" pattern on 
the top that most Sioux fully beaded moccasins have. The yellow pigment rubbed into the 
background is 
distinctive to the Southern Plains Nations, but these moccasins 
do not have the fringed back seam or fringes down the instep to the toe as do the Kiowa 
and Commanche mocs.Ethnologists Bob Edgar and Clyde Hall along with some of their associates have identified 
the moccasins as Arapaho. 

All the beads are Venetican glass, size 11 by current standards,
and all beads are the colors that were common in the nineteenth century but for the 
most part have not been made since. The background is the well-known but very scarce and 
expensive greasy yellows. The red is a red white-heart (not the rose red white-heart, but 
the common brighter red). The trader blue is that milky, greasy, semi-translucent light 
blue that was so common during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries but is so scarce
and costly now. The squares on the toe of the moccasins are of blue beads of a transparent 
thalo blue .

All stitching with the exception of the replacement soles has been done with sinue and is 
on brain tanned leather that is probably buffalo calf.

The beaded rows on the bands are done with eight beads per row, but in the toe area the 
rows contain ten up to fifteen beads on a single strand. This large number of beads lays 
down comparatively flat on this piece because it is done with sinew. These long strands 
look a bit loose and sloppy when we try to duplicate them
today substituting Nymo for sinew.

The pattern is the intellectual property of the original Arapapho artist: it can be used to inform new designs
for new moccasins but ought not to be directly copied.
