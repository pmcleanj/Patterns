There has been a lot of discussion
about the impact that the Corps of Discovery had on our country politically,
scientifically, and geographically, just to name a few. Let us, for a few moments, look at 
the more mundane aspects of the Expedition.

July
3rd, 1805. The men not other[wise] directed are dressing Skins to make
themselves mockinsins, as they have about wore them all out in the plains. One
pair of good mockinsons will not last more than about 2 days.</font></i></p>

-John Ordway*

Moccasins
were a very important part of the gear for the Corps of Discovery. With over
thirty members in the Expedition, each averaging a pair of moccasins every two
days....that's a lot of moccasins over two years! The fact that the above entry
was made is proof that is was a very important part of camp life. It may not
have been very glorious, but it was very necessary. Approximately 1-2 hours for
each member of the Expedition every evening were given to the maintenance and
making of moccasins.</font></p>

Moccasins
were made from the skin of a deer or elk that had been tanned using its own
brain (thus much softer and more supple than alum or bark tanned hides) and then
placed over an extremely smoky fire for several hours. The resultant leather was
called buckskin and would not be hard and crusty when it dried out.

What
follows are the instructions for a standard pair of center-seam moccasins
commonly worn by frontiersmen of the time period. The purpose of this task is to
give the students a better understanding of what the men of the Expedition had
to do on a daily basis in addition to walking, paddling, poling, hunting, etc.
Students are graded on participation.

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><font size="5">Your
new moccasins are done! </font></p>

The
only thing left to do now is to waterproof your new moccasins. Moccasin grease
is made from 2 parts tallow (beef or venison), 1 part beeswax, and 1 part
neetsfoot oil (originally made by boiling the hooves of a deer, cow, horse, etc.
and skimming the oil off the top; the rest was used for making glue.) Combine
the above ingredients. Heat them until they can be blended smooth. Pour into
tins and let cool. Put 4-5 coats on your moccasins initially, then another coat
every evening.</font></p>
